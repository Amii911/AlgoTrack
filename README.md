# AlgoTrack
Objective
Build a full-stack web application that allows users to systematically track their progress on coding challenges, analyze performance trends, and gain insights into their problem-solving journey.

Key Features
✅ Problem Logging (CRUD): Users can add, update, view, and delete coding problems with key details (name, difficulty, category, status, time taken, attempts, and notes).

✅ Filtering & Search: Users can filter problems by difficulty, category, status, and date, as well as search for specific problems.

✅ Performance Analytics: Charts and statistics to track success rates, time spent, problem-solving streaks, and weakest areas.

✅ User Authentication: Secure signup/login with JWT authentication to save personal progress.

✅ Notes & Review System: Users can attach notes to problems and mark problems as “Must Review” for later revision.

✅ Streak Tracking & Motivation: Users get streak alerts and can track consistency over days/weeks/months.
